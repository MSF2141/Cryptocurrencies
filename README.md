# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview
In this project, unsupervised machine learning models are used to create a classification system for a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio that would be offered to customers at Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank. Available data need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. To group the cryptocurrencies, a clustering algorithm is used. 

## Objectives
1. Preprocessing the Data for PCA
2. Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4. Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
